# Gemini-Chatbot---Law-Firm

## Introduction
The legal field demands precision, efficiency, and security, especially in specialized areas such as immigration law. Recognizing the challenges faced by Craig Relles Laws LLC, this proposal outlines the development of a mobile application designed to streamline operations, enhance client engagement, and securely manage sensitive data.

This application will serve as a centralized solution to address inefficiencies during client consultations, improve data management among paralegals, and securely store legacy case files. A key feature of this solution is a **custom Gemini-powered AI chatbot**, which will intelligently match clients with suitable lawyers based on their case details and legal needs.
